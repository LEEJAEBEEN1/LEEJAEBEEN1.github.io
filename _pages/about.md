As a Systems Biotechnology junior at Myongji University, I focus on cultivating a multidisciplinary approach to biological challenges. Rather than focusing solely on programming, I view tools like Python and Biopython as essential instruments for deciphering complex biological data. I am passionate about bridging the gap between theoretical biology and data-driven analysis. Through this opportunity, I aim to refine my ability to integrate domain expertise with technical literacy, evolving into a researcher who can navigate the future of life sciences with a versatile perspective.
